# Choosing A Text Editor:
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the mostimportant tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

## What features should you look for in a text editor? 
of the most important features are: 
1. code completion 
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue)
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them. You might find some other
features that are must-have's, but I think these features are a good
start.

**Every computer will come with its own text editor....**
On Mac computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Text Edit.” On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Notepad.” And on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text editor already installed but which one might depend on the flavor of your particular distribution. These text editors will go by different names. 

**Visual Studio Code**

Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft.It is available for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. VS Code has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS
already built-in with no additional work from you at all. VS Code has
everything: syntax highlighting, themes, extensions and code completion. It seems like VS Code has a very healthy following
in the web developing community.

### The Command Line!
-  The command line is an interesting beast, and if you've not used one before, can be a bit daunting. Don't worry, with a bit of practice you'll soon come to see it as your friend. Don't think of it as leaving the GUI behind so much as adding to it.
- A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
**opening a Terminal**
Opening a terminal is fairly easy,can't tell you exactly how to do it as every system is different.
**The Shell, Bash**
Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell. This tutorial will assume you are using bash as your shell.
**Shortcuts**
The terminal may seem daunting but don't fret. Linux is full of shortcuts to help make your life easier. You'll be introduced to several of them throughout this tutorial. Take note of them as not only do they make your life easier, they often also save you from making silly mistakes such as typos.

 **command**  
 - pwd: Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
 - ls:  list the contents of a directory.
 - cd:  Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
 **Paths**
In the previous commands we started touching on something called a path. I would like to go into more detail on them now as they are important in being proficient with Linux. Whenever we refer to either a file or directory on the command line, we are in fact referring to a path. ie. A path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.

**Everything is a file under Linux Even directories.**

#### The following are common extensions:
file.exe - an executable file,or program.
file.txt - a plain text file.
file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.

**Linux is Case Sensitive** 
- This is very important and a common - - - source of problems for people new to Linux. Other systems such as Windows are case insensitive when it comes to referring to files. Linux is not like this. As such it is possible to have two or more files and directories with the same name but letters of different case.
- Spaces in file and directory names are perfectly valid but we need to be a little careful with them. As you would remember, a space on the command line is how we seperate items.

**Quotes**
The first approach involves using quotes around the entire item. You may use either single or double quotes (later on we will see that there is a subtle difference between the two but for now that difference is not a problem). Anything inside quotes is considered a single item.

**Hidden Files and Directories**
Linux actually has a very simple and elegant mechanism for specifying that a file or directory is hidden. If the file or directory's name begins with a . (full stop) then it is considered to be hidden. You don't even need a special command or action to make a file hidden. Files and directories may be hidden for a variety of reasons. Configuration files for a particular user (which are normally stored in their home directory) are hidden for instance so that they don't get in the way of the user doing their everyday tasks.
