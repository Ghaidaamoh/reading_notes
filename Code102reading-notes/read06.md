# what is a script: 
- A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow 
in order to achieve a goal.
+ Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans so the instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.

## how do the computers fit in with the world around them:
-  Computer create models of the world using data.
- <p> The models use objects to represent physical things object
 can have: properties that tell us about the object, methods 
 that perform tasks using the properties of that object, event which are triggered whena user interacts with the computer.</p>
 - Web browser use HTML markup to create a model of the web pages.

  ### How do i write the script for a web pages:
  -the html <script> elements is used in html pages to tell the    browser to lode the javascript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a css file.)
  - it is best to keep javascript code in its own javascript file.
  javascript files are text files (like html pages and css style sheets) but they have the .js extension.
  - A script is made up of a series of statments.
 each statment is like a step in a recipe.
- script contain very precise instructions. 
for example,you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value 
- variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.

#### function:
 - JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed   by a name, followed by parentheses ().

- Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar   signs (same rules as variables).

- The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
  (parameter1, parameter2, ...)

- The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly      brackets: {}

- Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the       function definition.

- Function arguments are the values received by the function when it    is invoked.

- Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local   variables.

- A Function is much the same as a Procedure or a Subroutine, in        other programming languages.
