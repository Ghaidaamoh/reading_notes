# Redux - Additional Topics

**What’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?**

- The most 'redux-like' way of handling the pre-loading of data would be to fire off the asynchronous action in the lifecycle method (probably componentWillMount) of a Higher Order Component that wraps your app.

**When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?**

- You export the actions that follow the lifecycle of a request to an external API.

## Terms

- middleware: Redux middleware provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action, and the moment it reaches the reducer. People use Redux middleware for logging, crash reporting, talking to an asynchronous API, routing, and more.

- thunk: Redux Thunk is a middleware that allows you to call the action creators that return a function(thunk) which takes the store's dispatch method as the argument and which is afterwards used to dispatch the synchronous action after the API or side effects has been finished.
