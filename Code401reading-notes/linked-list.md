# What is a Linked List ?

- A linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

## How many types of linked lists what are they?

1. Singly Linked List: It is the most common. Each node has data and a pointer to the next node.
2. Doubly Linked List: We add a pointer to the previous node in a doubly-linked list. …
3. Circular Linked List: A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list in which the last element is linked to the first element.

### Memory management:

- The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory in our machines. Those of us who work with dynamically typed languages like Ruby, JavaScript, or Python don’t have to think about how much memory an array uses when we write our code on a day to day basis because there are several layers of abstraction that end up with us not having to worry about memory allocation at all.

# What’s a Linked List, pt1:

- data structures :ways of organizing our data.
- linked lists are a linear data structure, that means we traversed over the data sequentially.
- arrays and linked lists are linear data structure.
- linked lists are a dynamic data structure, that means every time we add a new element or node inside the linked  list will allocate a small space for this element only, and every element will take a special space for it when it’s created.

## What’s a Linked List, pt2:

- Big O notation is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.
- Big O determine how much the time & space we need to run this algorithm.
- Big O Notation is a way of evaluating the performance of an algorithm.
- O(n) : means that as our input grows, the space and time that we need to run that algorithm grows linearly.
- O(1) : means i need a constant time & and same space, and doesn’t matter how much the elements we have or how huge our input is.
