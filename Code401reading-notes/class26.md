# Component Based UI

**Review, Research, and Discussion** 

1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
   - Ext JS by Sencha
   - Angular
   - Redux
   - Three.js
   - Vue
   - Ember
   - Svelte 3

**What’s the difference between a framework and a library?**

- A library doesn’t change your entire work-flow and syntax, and you will usually just use it for a specific task and not the entire application.
Frameworks on the other hand will usually change your entire work-flow and a lot of your syntax, and will usually require quite a bit of time before you get used to using them.
Frameworks are usually much bigger projects also.

## Term:

- Rendering: Render refers to show output in browser and @JavaScript (programming language) utilize the document object to manipulate DOM elements.

- Templates: A design template or template is a file that is created with an overall layout to be used with one or more documents. For example, a program may have a template for a resume. With a resume template, the overall layout is designed with placeholder text (e.g., your objective, previous job experience, etc.) that you can replace with information relevant to you.

- State: 
   - React components has a built-in state object.
   - The state object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
   - When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
