**Images:**

- You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. This is very helpful when you use the same sized 
  images on several pages of your site.
- Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.
- You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page. 
- Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.
- You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
- To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

**Practical Information:**

- Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines.
- Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, 
  and what they do when they get there.
- To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.
- FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.
- Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website 
  tools (to save you writing them from scratch).

## Video and Audio APIs:

- HTML5 comes with elements for embedding rich media in documents — **video** and **audio** — which in turn 
  come with their own APIs for controlling playback, seeking, etc. This article shows you how to do common 
  tasks such as creating custom playback controls.

- the most interesting attribute is **controls,** which enables the default set of playback controls. 
  If you don't specify this, you get no playback controls.  
- **The HTML Media Element API:**
Part of the HTML5 spec, the HTMLMediaElement API provides features to allow you to control video
and audio players programmatically — for example HTMLMediaElement.play(), HTMLMediaElement.pause(), etc.
This interface is available to both **audio** and **video** elements, as the features you'll want to implement are nearly identical.
