# The Structure of HTML& CSS book:
**In order to teach you about creating web pages, 
this book is divided into three sections**
- **HTML:** is used to create web pages. 
- **CSS:** enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages.

  - **Presentation:** How to control things like the color of text      the fonts you want to use and the size of those fonts, how to add 
    background colors to pages (or parts of a page), and how to add 
    background images.
  - **Layout:** How to control where the different elements are 
    positioned on the screen. You will also learn several techniques 
    that professionals use to make their pages more attractive.
- **Practical:** We end up with some helpful information that will      assist you in building better websites.HTML5 is the latest version    of HTML There is a chapter that talks you through a design process    that you might like to follow when creating a new website.

## How People Access the Web:
- Browsers: People access websites using software called a web          browser.
  - **Popular examples include:**
    Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.In order to view a web page, users might type a web address into their browser, follow a link from another site, or use a bookmark.
    Software manufacturers regularly release new versions of browsers with new features and supporting new additions to languages.
- **Web Servers:** Web servers are special computers that are           constantly connected to the Internet, and are optimized to send web   pages out to people who request them.Some big companies run their     own web servers, but it is more common to use the services of a web   hosting   company who charge a fee to host your site.
- **Devices:** People are accessing websites on an increasing range     of devices including desktop computers,laptops, tablets, and mobile 
  phones. 
- **Screen readers:** Screen readers are programs that read out the     contents of a computer screen to a user. Throughout this book you     will see several references to screen readers.
# chap1:  
- HTML pages are text documents.
- HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give   the information they surround special meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a    piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
- Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the       content of that element.
- Attributes require a name and a value.
- To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to     use, what they do, and where they can go.

## chap8: 
- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you using.
- You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular          elements.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and      inline elements together.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages   can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about    your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special characters in your      pages such as <, >, and Â©.
  ### chap17:
- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a   web page and help to describe its structure.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple   <div> elements).
- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be       told which elements are block-level elements.
- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older         versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available       free from Google.
#### chap18: 
- It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they    would come to your site, what information they want to find and       when they are likely to return.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to    go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors        understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information using size,       color, and style. 
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the              information you present.
# JavaScript book:
**what is a script and how to create one:**
- A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow     in order to achieve a goal. 
- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the      instructions. 
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your      instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. 
- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into 
  a series of tasks and then work out each step needed 
  to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
**How to write a script for a web page:**
- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file.        JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style        sheets), but they have the j s extension. 
- The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser   to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be    used to load a CSS file). 
- If you view the source code of the page in the browser,the            JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,because the script works    with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
