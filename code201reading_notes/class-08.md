**CSS page layout techniques:** allow us to take elements contained in a web page and control where they are
 positioned relative to their default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around them, their 
parent container, or the main
 
**layout techniques**

- Normal flow: Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page
before any changes are made to their layout. The flow is essentially a set of things that are all working 
together and know about each other in your layout.

- The display property: The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box) of an element.
ex1 {display: none;}
ex2 {display: inline;}
ex3 {display: block;}
ex4 {display: inline-block;}

- Flexbox: When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes â€” the main axis and the cross axis. 
The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it.

- Grid: The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier 
to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.

- Floats:CSS property places an element on the left or right side of its container, allowing text and inline 
elements to wrap around it.
 
- Positioning:The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

**There are five different position values:**
1. static.
2. relative.
3. fixed.
4. absolute.
5. sticky.

## HTML& CSS books:

- **div** elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column 
  layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 
  pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
