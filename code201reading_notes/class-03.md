**chap3:**
There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists.

**HTML provides us with three different types:**
- Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, 
  the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract 
  where each point needs to be identified by a section number.
- Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point(rather than characters that indicate order).
- Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

-Ordered Lists:
 - **ol:** The ordered list is created with the **ol** element.
 - **li:** Each item in the list is placed between an opening **li** tag 
   and a closing **li** tag. (The li stands for list item.)
- Unordered List:
  - **ul:** The unordered list is created with the **ul** element.
  - **li:** Each item in the list is placed between an opening li tag and a closing /li tag. 
    (The li stands for list item.
- Definition Lists:
  - **dl:** The definition list is created with the **dl** element and usually 
    consists of a series of terms and their definitions.Inside the **dl** element you will 
    usually see pairs of **dt** and **dd** elements.
  - **dt:** This is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term).
  - **dd:** This is used to contain the definition.

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. 
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

- CREATING AN ARRAY:
  create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var 
  keyword followed by the name of the array).The values are assigned to the array inside a pair 
  of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma. The values in the array do not need to 
  be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array.
  This technique for creating an array is known as an array literal. It is usually the preferred method for creating an array. 
  You can also write each value on a separate line .
- VALU ES IN ARRAYS: Values in an array are accessed as if they are in 
  a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).
- NUMBERING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY: Each item in an array is automatically given a number called an index. This can be used 
  to access specific items in the array.
- ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY: To retrieve the third item on the list, the array name is specified 
  along with the index number in square brackets. 
- NUMBER OF ITEMS IN AN ARRAY: Each array has a property called length, which holds the number 
  of items in the array.

**chap4:**
- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true,
  and another if it is false. 
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default 
  option if none match).
