![layotimage](https://www.w3schools.com/html/img_sem_elements.gif)
- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column 
  layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 
  pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

## JavaScript book:
**chap3:**
**WHAT IS A FUNCTION?**
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat 
the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
**How to declare function**
function name([param[, param,[..., param]]]) {
   [statements]
}
**how to call a function:**
use function name followed by parentheses
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. 
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object. 
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the 
  browser window. 
- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and 
  methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
 
### pair programming

**How does pair programming work?**
 While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.
 Handling the «mechanics» of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, 
and—of course writing—code. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might
 be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
