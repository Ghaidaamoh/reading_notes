# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

- Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting 
  themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into
  faster, better and more productive versions of themselves. We're living through a golden age of understanding personal 
  productivity, says Marshall Van Alstyne, a professor at Boston University who studies how people share information. 
  All of a sudden, we can pick apart the small choices that all of us make, decisions most of us don't even notice, and 
  figure out why some people are so much more effective than everyone else.

- Google’s research had identified dozens of behaviors that seemed important, except that sometimes the norms of one effective
  team contrasted sharply with those of another equally successful group. In fact, the data sometimes pointed in opposite directions. 

- Which group would you rather join? Over the past century, psychologists made considerable progress in defining and systematically 
  measuring intelligence in individuals, the researchers wrote in the journal Science in 2010. ‘‘We have used the statistical approach 
  they developed for individual intelligence to systematically measure the intelligence of groups.

- What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others.
  Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished 
  the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. ‘‘Some teams had a bunch of smart people who 
  figured out how to break up work evenly,’’ said Anita Woolley, the study’s lead author.

- **First** on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in 
  distribution of conversational turn-taking.

- **Second** the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others 
 felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. People on the more successful teams in Woolley’s experiment 
 scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average.
