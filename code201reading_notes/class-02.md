# HTML& CSS book:
**chap2:**
Headings and paragraphs
- Headings:
  - h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
HTML has six "levels" of headings:
h1 is used for main headings h2 is used for subheadings If there are further sections under the subheadings then the h3 element is used, and so on..
- paragraphs: To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p> tag and closing </p> tag.
- Bold & Italic: 
  - By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.
  - By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic.
- They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).
**chap10:**
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements    should look like).
- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those              properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred         typeface.
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

## JavaScript book:
**chap2:**

*what is a script:*
- A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is  like a step in a recipe. 
- Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a        calculation using that value. 
- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. 
- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one  piece of related information. 
-JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
- Expressions evaluate into a single value. 
- Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

**chap4:**
- Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. 
- Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. 
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 
- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 
- switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match). 
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 
- There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
